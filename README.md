# react-testing-excercise

In this exercise we are going to do unit tests to our react application. In addition to this, we have add coverage configuration
and continuous integration with Travis-ci.

# Steps to build it

"npm run test" to execute tests once.
"npm run test:watch" to execute tests in watch mode.
"npm run test:coverage" to execute tests and show our code coverage

# Demo CI
